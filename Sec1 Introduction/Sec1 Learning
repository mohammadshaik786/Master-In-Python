Interpreter which makes computer to understand human language(code) and it converts into 1 & 0(machine code) line by line where as compiler does the entire source code into machine code.

To print, we can use either '' or ""

To print the string having integer variable, we need to convert integer to string by using function - str(varname)
To find the datatype of variable, we can use function - type(varname)

Index & Slicing
Basic String Methods : .upper(),.lower(),
.capitalize() -> It converts first letter of sentence into Upper case.
.isdigit() -> prints boolean val (checks only number in var and prints True or False)
.isalnum() -> checks only number & alphabets in var
.startswith()
.endswith()
etc..

Formatting strings using Format Method:
print("My First Name is {0}, Last Name is {1} and Middle Name is {2}".format('Mohammad','Shaikh','Suleiman'))
------------------
Strings are immutable(it cannot be changed)
It is not possible to modify with index letter. Instead we can create brand new string i.e

name = 'Mohammad Shaik'
# name[9:] = 'Sulaiman'
name = name[0:8] + ' Sulaiman'
print(name)
---------------------

Method is associated to class where as Function is not associated to class.

The Method is a function which we use in class for invoking and it is a object oriented concept.
A method is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You can pass data, known as parameters, into a method.
Methods are used to perform certain actions, and they are also known as functions.
